      "answer":
          "Phishing starts with a fraudulent email or other communication that is designed to lure a victim. The message is made to look as though it comes from a trusted sender. If it fools the victim, he or she is coaxed into providing confidential information, often on a scam website. Sometimes malware is also downloaded onto the target’s computer."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the dangers of phishing attacks?",
      "answer":
          "Sometimes attackers are satisfied with getting a victim’s credit card information or other personal data for financial gain. Other times, phishing emails are sent to obtain employee login information or other details for use in an advanced attack against a specific company. Cybercrime attacks such as advanced persistent threats (APTs) and ransomware often start with phishing."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I protect against phishing attacks?",
      "answer":
          "One way to protect your organization from phishing is user education. Education should involve all employees. High-level executives are often a target. Teach them how to recognize a phishing email and what to do when they receive one. Simulation exercises are also key for assessing how your employees react to a staged phishing attack.Security technologyNo single cybersecurity technology can prevent phishing attacks. Instead, organizations must take a layered approach to reduce the number of attacks and lessen their impact when they do occur. Network security technologies that should be implemented include email and web security, malware protection, user behavior monitoring, and access control."

      "question": "History and Need for Firewall",
      "answer":
          "Before Firewalls, network security was performed by Access Control Lists (ACLs) residing on routers. ACLs are rules that determine whether network access should be granted or denied to specific IP addresses. But ACLs cannot determine the nature of the packet it is blocking. Also, ACL alone does not have the capacity to keep threats out of the network. Hence, the Firewall was introduced."
    },
    {
      "question": "Working of Firewall",
      "answer":
          "Firewall matches the network traffic against the rule set defined in its table. Once the rule is matched, an associated action is applied to the network traffic. Rules can be defined on the firewall based on the necessity and security policies of the organization. Firewall maintains a distinct set of rules for both outgoing and incoming traffic."
